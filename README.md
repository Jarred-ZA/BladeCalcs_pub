# BladeCalcs

A Python-based tool for calculating and analyzing various blade-related parameters and natural frequencies for NACA airfoil profiles. This tool provides a comprehensive suite of calculations and visualizations directly from the command line.

## Features

-   Dynamically generates NACA 4-digit airfoil profiles (e.g., NACA 2412).
-   Calculates geometric properties (Area, Moments of Inertia Ix, Iy, Ixy, Centroid Cx, Cy) using approximate, exact (trapezoidal), and polynomial methods.
-   Computes natural frequencies for:
    -   Lumped mass cantilever systems
    -   Distributed mass cantilever systems (Modes 1-4)
    -   Euler-Bernoulli clamped-free beam theory (Modes 1-4)
-   Calculates Euler-Bernoulli mode shapes.
-   Outputs detailed calculation results to the terminal.
-   Generates a multi-panel plot showing:
    -   2D airfoil profile with centroid.
    -   3D visualization of the twisted blade.
    -   Calculated mode shapes.
-   Includes Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations for bar and beam elements (in `fem.py`, currently not integrated into the main output).

## Requirements

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   Required packages (see `requirements.txt`):
    -   `numpy==1.24.0`
    -   `scipy==1.10.0`
    -   `matplotlib==3.7.0`

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual repo URL if different
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BladeCalcs.git
    cd BladeCalcs
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will:
1.  Print the detailed calculation results (properties, frequencies) to the terminal.
2.  Display a Matplotlib window containing a 2x2 plot:
    -   Top-Left: 2D NACA profile with centroid.
    -   Top-Right: 3D visualization of the twisted blade.
    -   Bottom-Left: Calculated Euler-Bernoulli mode shapes.
    -   Bottom-Right: Empty placeholder plot.

Input parameters like the NACA profile number, material properties (E, rho), length (L), twist factor, and 3D layer count are currently hardcoded within `main.py`.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: Main script entry point, defines inputs, runs calculations, generates plots.
-   `calcs.py`: Core calculation functions (geometric properties, frequencies, mode shapes).
-   `naca.py`: Generates NACA airfoil coordinates (based on work by Dirk Gorissen).
-   `fem.py`: Finite Element Method functions (bar and beam).
-   `plot3D.py`: Contains a basic 3D plotter function (currently not used by `main.py`).
-   `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.
-   `README.md`: This documentation file.

The Naca blade profiles are generated by a python library (naca.py) originally by Dirk Gorissen.


Geometric properties are determined:


A,Ix,Iy,Txy,Cx,Cy (Approximations, exact solutions and numerical solutions are provided)


Physical Properties can be entered:


E,rho [Pa,kg/m^3]


Idealised Beam calculations are computed:


1. lumped mass
2. distributed mass
3. Euler Bunullie clamped -Free
4. Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes are computed
5. Blade properties can be entered
6. % twist and rotation point (CG).


Outputs:


1. 2D blade.
2. Blade profile is plotted with twist.
3. Mode Shapes.
