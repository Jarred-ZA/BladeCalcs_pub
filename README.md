# BladeCalcs


A python program to run analytical calculations on NACA blade profiles.


The Naca blade profiles are generated by a python library (naca.py) originally by Dirk Gorissen.


Geometric properties are determined:


A,Ix,Iy,Txy,Cx,Cy (Approximations, exact solutions and numerical solutions are provided)


Physical Properties can be entered:


E,rho [Pa,kg/m^3]


Idealised Beam calculations are computed:


1. lumped mass
2. distributed mass
3. Euler Bunullie clamped -Free
4. Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes are computed
5. Blade properties can be entered
6. % twist and rotation point (CG).


Outputs:


1. 2D blade.
2. Blade profile is plotted with twist.
3. Mode Shapes.
